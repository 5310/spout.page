  "blurb": "<p>The book Alice in Wonderland failed to be named in an 1888 poll of the publishing season's most popular children's stories.</p><p>Generally it received poor reviews, with reviewers giving more credit to Tenniel's illustrations than to Carroll's story. At the release of Through the Looking-Glass, the first Alice tale gained in popularity and by the end of the 19th century Sir Walter Besant wrote that Alice in Wonderland \"was a book of that extremely rare kind which will belong to all the generations to come until the language becomes obsolete\".<p><p>In 2014, Robert McCrum named the tale \"one of the best loved in the English canon\", and called it \"perhaps the greatest, possibly most influential, and certainly the most world-famous Victorian English fiction\".</p>",
